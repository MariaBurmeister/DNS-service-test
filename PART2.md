We now should have a backend responding to requests for NS, SOA and ANY records for all domains managed by us.

Based on this we want to add the functionality to configure MX records for domains.

 * The interviewe should have prepared on the topic of MX records and should give a quick overview
 * The interviewer should expand on this overview, so the interviewe knows all information relevant to the task
 * The interviewe should explain how he thinks the service could best be extended to support setting, updating and deleting custom MX records for domains and to retrieve those MX records via the existing lookup function. The interviewe should also mention if he sees any potential problems or sensible alternate solutions.
 * The interviewer and interviewe should agree on a solution
 * The interviewe should implement the solution with help and guidance of the interviewer
